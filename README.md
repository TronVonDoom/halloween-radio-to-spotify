   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
   The application will start monitoring and provide:
   - **Web Interface**: http://localhost:3000 - Real-time dashboard
   - **Terminal Output**: Live logs and status updates

For development with auto-restart:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Web Interface

Once running, visit **http://localhost:8731** to access the monitoring dashboard featuring:

- **üìä Real-time Station Status**: See which stations are connected
- **üéµ Spotify Playlist Links**: Direct links to your auto-generated playlists  
- **üìù Live Activity Logs**: Watch tracks being detected and added
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Unmatched Tracks**: View tracks that didn't meet the match threshold
- **üìà Database Statistics**: Track counts, success rates, and analytics
- **üìã Track History**: Searchable history of all matched and unmatched tracks
- **üîÑ Auto-refresh**: Updates every 5 seconds automatically

## Database Structure

The application uses SQLite for persistent data storage (`data/halloween_radio.db`):

- **matched_tracks**: Successfully added tracks with full metadata and match percentages
- **unmatched_tracks**: Failed matches for analysis and potential retry
- **playlists**: Station and playlist tracking information
- **stats**: Daily statistics per station with success rates and averages
- **Views**: Pre-built reports for daily summaries and top unmatched tracks

## Configuration

The application automatically creates these Spotify playlists:
- Halloween Radio - Main
- Halloween Radio - Movies  
- Halloween Radio - Oldies
- Halloween Radio - Kids

## Logging

- **Activity Logs**: `logs/app.log` - General application activity and track processing
- **Error Logs**: `logs/error.log` - Application errors and issues
- **Database**: All matched/unmatched track details stored in SQLite database
